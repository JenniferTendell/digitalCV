                <p class="about-me-text grey text"> I’ve always had an interest for colors, shapes and creating things through my creative mind. 
                    As a little girl I used to make my own jewelry, nail art and paintings. Later on, I became 
                    more digital and continued my work in photoshop and illustrator. I love the process of 
                    putting things together to see how it can become something new. I’m a curious, calm and 
                    positive teamplayer that got an eye for details. 
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to follow my interests and moved to Halmstad for three years to study Digital Design 
                    and Innovation. The education focused on user centered design and I learned to always see my 
                    design through different perspectives. I realized that design is so much more than just the look. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now I’m eager to know how to make designs come to life! I’m on my way right now as a student at 
                    Medieinstitutet. If everything goes as planed, I can call myself a Front End Developer by the year 2022.
